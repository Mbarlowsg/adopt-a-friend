                <!-- Mission Statement -->
                <p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
                <p>At <strong>Adopt A Friend Animal Rescue</strong>, we are passionate about rescuing abandoned, neglected, and unwanted animals and providing them with a second chance at life. Our goal is to connect animals in need with loving, forever homes, and to promote responsible pet ownership. We are dedicated to reducing the number of homeless pets by advocating for adoption and animal welfare, ensuring that every animal has a chance to thrive in a safe, loving environment.</p>

                <!-- Who We Are -->
                <p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
                <p>Founded in [Year], <strong>Adopt A Friend Animal Rescue</strong> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization committed to making a difference in the lives of animals. Our team of dedicated volunteers, foster families, veterinarians, and animal care professionals works tirelessly to rescue animals from shelters, provide them with necessary medical care, and place them into loving homes. We also strive to raise awareness about the importance of spaying and neutering and responsible pet care.</p>

                <!-- Our Programs -->
                <p><strong>Our Programs</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Animal Rescue & Adoption:</strong> We rescue animals from high-kill shelters, strays, and cases of neglect or abuse. After receiving medical care and behavioral support, we work hard to match each animal with their perfect forever home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foster Care Program:</strong> Our foster care program is essential in providing temporary homes for animals while they await adoption. Foster families provide care, love, and socialization to help these animals transition to their new homes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education & Advocacy:</strong> We believe in educating the public about responsible pet ownership, the importance of spaying/neutering, and advocating for animal rights. Through community outreach and educational programs, we empower individuals to make informed decisions about pets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Veterinary Care:</strong> Every animal in our care receives comprehensive veterinary services, including vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and treatments for any health issues. Our goal is to ensure each animal is healthy and ready for adoption.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Why Adopt? -->
